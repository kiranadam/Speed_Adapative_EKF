# Speed_Adapative_EKF

This is Speed Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter for Vehicle Position and Attitude Estimation with Low Cost GNSS and IMU Sensors. It handles the missing of GNSS measurements. Its based on the paper "EPE and Speed Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter for Vehicle Position
and Attitude Estimation with Low Cost GNSS and IMU Sensors" by Balzer et.al
